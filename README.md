I Created This Cool Interactive Map w/ React Leaflet.

I mapped out the Tesla Charging Stations in Portugal using latitude & longitude, as well as their status (i.e. "Active", "Under Construction", etc.) and the number of changing stations per location! I pulled this JSON data from a site that provides live info on Tesla Superchargers from around the world.
